I've been interested in programming ever since I first played with a Commodore 64 in third grade. I knew there was a way to get the computer to do what you wanted to do and it didn't take me long to learn just enough BASIC to enable me to fill every screen at the Department Store computer display with whatever I wanted it to say. Over the years, I dabbled in C++, HTML (the internet was brand spanking new,) Java, and Visual Basic. Now [I use modern tools](#portfolio) like JavaScript, bootstrap, and jQuery to create web applications. [Contact me](#contact) and we'll work together to make a website you'll be proud of.
