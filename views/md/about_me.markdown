###Your Story

At the heart of any great bio is a story. A good story is something that both your fans and reviewers will be compelled to pass along. It’s not only valuable for your bio, it’s something that should always be on the tip of your tongue when someone asks you about what you do.

Hint: Your story already exists. You just need to find it.

Another Hint: Many of your facts may be part of your story. Feel free to sprinkle them in.

Finding Your Story
A story, in its simplest form, is simply a problem and a resolution. Here’s a made-up example:

“We wanted to start a bluegrass band but there were no fiddle players in our town. So, we paid for my little brother to take fiddle lessons, and a year later the Tweed Brothers were born.”

Pretty simple, right?

Problem: Need fiddle player
Resolution: Trained little brother to play fiddle.
