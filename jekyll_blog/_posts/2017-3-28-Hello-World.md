### What?

I have a blog that I made myself--okay, I modified the [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/) jekyll theme. But I figured out how to integrate a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog with my [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) website myself--okay, I had help from Derek Eder's [meta blog post](http://derekeder.com/blog/hello-world-setting-up-a-jekyll-blog-in-sinatra) about setting up that very thing. I guess the point is that we are all standing on the shoulders of giants. Hopefully eventually some of the content I generate here will end up helping future coders, beer makers, home cookers, and gamers the way those resources helped me.

Yes, that's right. I'm planning on trying to make the content mostly coding related, but since I am a relatively well rounded person, This will include posts about my other hobbies and interests. This should also mean I'm more likely to post more regular content if I do that.

### Why?

Why start a blog? Well, the cynical reason is that I've been learning to code for the past almost two years and I want to get a job: from what I've been told, having a blog will help with that. The less cynical reason is that part of why I've been getting back into coding is that I love to create. This is a common theme through my hobbies, and I want to extend that into my work. Since a blog is creating content, this will feed into that creative drive.

### How?

Blogging about my coding struggles and triumphs will not only help the hypothetical future learner, but it will also help me via the [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) method where explaining code to someone else can help you understand it better and work out problems in it yourself. Another benefit for me is now I will have a single resource to go back to when I want to solve the same problem again rather than reinventing the wheel. Not to mention a similar benefit to looking back to previous beers I've made, recipes I've tried, and gaming experiences I have had.

### When?

Time to get moving and try to crack the code.
