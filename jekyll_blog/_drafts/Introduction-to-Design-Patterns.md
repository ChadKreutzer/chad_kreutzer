[Design Patterns: Elements of Reuseable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chadkreutzer-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201633612&linkId=868c3a314f3c8199a22c226b2dad8037)
, also known as "The Gang of Four," is a seminal book in the coding world.
Since I've been working in Ruby and Ruby is an object oriented language, I
thought it would behove me to learn how to do it right. And what better way to
do that than sharing it with others? This will be a series on the different
design patterns cataloged in the book.

Since twenty-three is an aweful lot, I'll start with the eight recommended in
the Guide to Readers section:

* Abstract Factory
* Factory Method
* Adapter
* Observer
* Composite
* Strategy
* Decorator
* Template Method

According to the Gang of Four, these are the simplest and most common patterns
and "This subset will help you understand design patterns in particular and
good object-oriented design in general." After I finish these, I'll reasses and
decide if it is worth continuing on blogging about the other fifteen. So, on
with the show!
