The Facts
Figure out what needs to be said and say it. Using bullet points or subject headers will make it easier for someone to scan the page and grab what they need. If you want to expand information you can use hyperlinks to send the curious to external pages. The only rule here: be brief and get to the point. You want to keep your website bio no longer than a page.

The Facts You Need:

Mission statement (One or two sentences saying who you are and why you are doing what you are doing.)
The people (This might just be you. A music project would probably list all the band members.)
Major accomplishments (List a few shining moments. Could be a performance, an award, or achievement.)
A quote or two from a notable media source. 
Your contact info (Linking to a form or contact page is fine.)
Timeline ([blank] was formed in 1999, etc.)
Your Story
At the heart of any great bio is a story. A good story is something that both your fans and reviewers will be compelled to pass along. It’s not only valuable for your bio, it’s something that should always be on the tip of your tongue when someone asks you about what you do.

Hint: Your story already exists. You just need to find it.

Another Hint: Many of your facts may be part of your story. Feel free to sprinkle them in.

Finding Your Story
A story, in its simplest form, is simply a problem and a resolution. Here’s a made-up example:

“We wanted to start a bluegrass band but there were no fiddle players in our town. So, we paid for my little brother to take fiddle lessons, and a year later the Tweed Brothers were born.”

Pretty simple, right?

Problem: Need fiddle player
Resolution: Trained little brother to play fiddle.
